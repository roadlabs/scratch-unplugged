## Closing of Google Code ##
You can download zip files with source and binary code and learning materials from
my web site: [software tools](http://www.weizmann.ac.il/sci-tea/benari/software/index.html)
and [files associated with textbooks](http://www.weizmann.ac.il/sci-tea/benari/books/index.html).

If you wish to initiate a collaborative development, the projects are also available as repositories on [GitHub](https://github.com/motib?tab=repositories).


## Computer Science Unplugged ##
Computer Science Unplugged (http://csunplugged.org/) is a set of activities designed to introduce young people to computer science using entertaining dramatizations instead of a computer.

## Scratch ##
Scratch (http://scratch.mit.edu/) is a program development environment designed for young people.

There is a separate website for educators (http://scratched.media.mit.edu/).

The projects were written in Scratch 1.4 but should also run in Scratch 2.0 by selecting `Upload from your computer` from the `File` menu.

## Scratch Unplugged ##
These projects test the capabilities of Scratch by implementing the algorithms in the CS Unplugged activities. Possible uses:
  * To demonstrate algorithms without carrying out the activities.
  * Review the activities that were done elsewhere.
  * Facilitate the transition from the activities to programming.
  * Students looking for advanced projects can modify or extend the projects.

## Other activities ##
  * Activity [The Intelligent Piece of Paper](http://csunplugged.org/intelligent-paper) has been implemented by Dimitris Nikolos in Scratch 2.0 and can be found at:http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/10112737/.

## Scratch Projects for Learning Mathematics ##
This archive contains two projects for learning about mathematics. One project concerns triangles and their measurements (lengths and angles). The other is a game for learning arithmetic.
